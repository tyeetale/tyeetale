# About Me

Hi, I'm Thomas, a designer and developer with over 5 years of experience. I enjoy building cool things from scratch, whether it's ideas, products, or marketing strategies. I'm am extreme generalist focused on adapting and scaling my work across different mediums, infrastructures, and tech stacks.

I'm also an avid adventurer, always seeking new experiences and perspectives. I love to chat about food, culture, and tech.
