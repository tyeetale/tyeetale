🚀 About Me

Hey, I’m Thomas — an analyst, developer, and cross-functional strategist with 8+ years of experience in analytics and development. **I’m obsessed with building systems that bridge disciplines, infrastructure, and tech stacks—breaking down complexity, scaling ideas, and turning concepts into reality.**

Right now, I’m helping engineers build rockets @blueorigin, channeling my entrepreneurial mindset into the ultimate “launch” of all — space exploration.

Beyond work, I’m a relentless adventurer, always chasing new experiences, cultures, and perspectives. If you’re into deep dives on food, innovation, or the future of humanity, let’s connect. 🚀🔥
