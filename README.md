# About Me

Hi, I'm Thomas, a designer and developer with over five years of experience. I enjoy building cool things from scratch, whether it's ideas, products, or marketing strategies. I am an extreme generalist focused on adapting and scaling my work across different mediums, infrastructures, and tech stacks.

I'm also an exuberant adventurer, always seeking new experiences and perspectives. I love to chat about food, culture, and tech.

Please feel free to reach out to me!
