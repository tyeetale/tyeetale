ðŸš€ About Me

Hey there, traveler! My name is Thomas, a builder and systems thinker with a background that blends finance, analytics, and engineering. **Iâ€™m obsessed with creating evolving systems by breaking down complexity, scaling ideas, and turning concepts into reality.**

Iâ€™ve worn many hats along the way as a founder, designer, and software engineer, and now Iâ€™m helping engineers build rockets at Blue Origin, channeling that same curiosity and drive into building humanityâ€™s future in space.

Beyond work, Iâ€™m a relentless adventurer, always chasing new experiences, cultures, and perspectives. If youâ€™re into deep dives on food, innovation, or the future of humanity, letâ€™s connect. ðŸš€ðŸ”¥
