Stemming away from partnership ideas from Coopsight, my cofounders and I ventured into a new direction: social media and the power of micro-influencers. We wanted to create a platform that would allow brands to control and jumpstart viral marketing trends, while not having to spend on big brand deals and money-wasting ad campaigns.

As such, I devised a two sided marketplace design that would allow people to join into Fibes and win prizes from brands by making certain types of content. This ranges from spicy hot ramen challenges to bespoke clothing.

By leveraging the power of micro-influencers and user-generated content. Brands could tap into the vast potential of passionate creators to drive genuine engagement, build brand awareness, and establish lasting connections with their target audience. By incentivizing users to produce content aligned with brands' objectives, Fibes offered an innovative solution for both brands and aspiring micro-influencers.

Our platform sought to maximize the impact of micro-influencers and viral content while minimizing costs. Through Fibes, brands had the opportunity to connect with their audiences in an authentic and impactful way, bypassing the need for expensive partnerships and ineffective ad campaigns.

In summary, the team's shift towards social media and micro-influencers led to the creation of Fibes, a two-sided marketplace. The platform aimed to empower brands to ignite viral marketing trends and engage with their target audience effectively. With an intuitive design system and brand identity, Fibes offered a solution that revolutionized traditional marketing approaches by leveraging the power of user-generated content and micro-influencers.
