As an avid anime watcher, it has always fustrated me on how design and user experience is so lacking in the anime space. For context to those that do not know, there is around 3 websites that have dominated the space of anime news for the last 10 years, and the design of these sites really shows. Each one of these are more about reviewing animes and giving news, rather than a schedule for a user. The only way to get reminders for anime shows is to use a calendar app and manually add each show to your calendar. This is a very tedious process, and I wanted to make something that would make this process easier.

So it got me thinking about designs focused on personalization of people's schedules with the data that is already out there.

Especially given that most anime are TV shows with a weekly scheduled broadcast, I decided to make a simple web app that would allow users to get personalized reminders for their favorite anime shows.
