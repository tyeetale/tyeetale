The genesis of this innovative startup can be traced back to a profound realization: great businesses are the result of tightly coupled innovations.

This revelation was ignited by observing the remarkable success stories emerging from China, where transformative partnerships were occurring behind the scenes, fueling groundbreaking innovations in fintech, e-commerce, and social media.

Witnessing the profound impact of these partnerships on driving exponential growth, I admit that this idea came about because my cofounders, Erol and George, approached me with an idea on how to to bring a similar approach to startups worldwide. With my cofounders having a background in venture capital, they approached me with a compelling vision and need for a designer.

Recognizing the importance for a streamlined solution, I joined the team because I really wanted to empower startups to easily jumpstart partnerships with other companies, and to go above the 70% failure line. And so, I embarked on the journey to design a product that distilled these inspirations into a powerful matchmaking app.

Together, we 3 co-founders iterated many times in many different ways to bring this vision to more eyes. We were able to successfully present to a variety of prominent VCs and demonstrate how portfolio companies could be matched together to create synergies. We were also able to present to a variety of accelerators.

Then, we went ahead and built a simple system for startups to match together. Through constant evolution on our value proposition, I learned how to quickly design products alongside programming and marketing to reach many demographics of customers.

By focusing on systems and processes, I was able to learn how to build a startup from the ground up and set the design groundwork to create a cohesive brand identity.
