Being a nomad has been a part of identity for a long time. I've had many travels and the most challenging and rewarding experience I've ever had was studying in university, at NYU Shanghai. Facing new cultures and unfamiliar territories, I had to learn how to navigate the world on my own. I had to learn how to plan my trips, how to find the best places to eat, and how to get around. I had to learn how to exist in a place initially foreign.

And it was through this that I learned to empathize that this problem persists to any such traveler away from home.
There is this feeling of being overwhelmed and scattered, both in mind and in the tools that currently exist.

Which is extremely unfortunate, because the world is a beautiful place, and it's a shame that we can't enjoy it to the fullest. It shouldn't have to be this way. It doesn't have to be this way.

And so... I decided I needed to do something about it.

Tildenn's main goal is simplicity. It's about being a non-obtrusive minimalist tool that would help people like me, who love to travel and explore new places, and plan for the unknown. It's about focusing on the adventure, in all it's simple, flexible, and beautiful glory.

The world is meant to be explored, and there is a lot of great inspirations everywhere to help with this. It is simply unacceptable to not think about how we can make travel experience better, especially the planning part.

And so, this app is both a showcase, but also a deeper idealogy about the importance of design and its impact on customers. Design is not just about making things look pretty, it's about making things easier for the user. It's about making things more efficient, more effective, and more enjoyable. It's about making things better.
