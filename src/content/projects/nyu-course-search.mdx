Great ideas are easily recognizable. So when I heard about how an indie hacker went ahead and improved Harvard's Course Search as found on [here](https://classes.wtf), I had to do something similiar for my community at NYU.

For context, all students at NYU use a course registrar called Albert. In a nutshell, it's a very slow system, and it's not uncommon for students to spend hours searching for courses.

And so, I went ahead with a friend to construct a better course search tool for NYU. With me working on the design and frontend, and my partner working on collecting the data shown on Albert, we completely changed the database and frontend experience to be build for speed.

At the end of the day, we were able to create a tool that was minimally 10x faster than Albert, taking less than 2 seconds to search for a course. with built in fuzzy search.
